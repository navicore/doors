Kubernetes Platformer
==========

Plans:
------

* As an explorer tool
    * Platformer game with jumping.
      * space bar is jumping
      * left arrow right arrow to move
      * up arrow to enter doorways
      * entering a doorway renders a new room/game and the player drops into the
        room from a door near the ceiling
      * to leave a room/game, use the bottom center door and player will reenter the
        outer room from one of the sides
* As a game
    * Loot
        * Some loot gives powers
            * move faster
            * x-ray vision
            * teleportation like nvim harpoon
        * Some loot gives your world beautiful details
        * Final boss gives you world builder ability - you can make a system
          just with your fav stuff
