Kubernetes Platformer
==========

A fun Kubernetes UI as I learn Bevy and game programming.

```
cargo run --features bevy/dynamic_linking
```

Plans:
------
* Platformer game with jumping.
  * space bar is jumping
  * left arrow right arrow to move
  * up arrow to enter doorways
  * entering a doorway renders a new room/game and the player drops into the
    room from a door near the ceiling
  * to leave a room/game, use the bottom center door
